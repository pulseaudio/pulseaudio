; Steelseries Arctis 7 USB and Arctis Pro Wireless USB headset. These headsets 
; have a microphone and two output devices. The first output device is mono, 
; meant for voice audio, and the second one is stereo, meant for everything 
; else. The purpose of this unusual design is to provide separate volume 
; controls for voice and other audio, which can be useful in gaming.
