; Default profile definitions for the ALSA backend of PulseAudio. This
; is used as fallback for all cards that have no special mapping
; assigned (and should be good enough for the vast majority of
; cards). If you want to assign a different profile set than this one
; to a device, either set the udev property PULSE_PROFILE_SET for the
; card, or use the "profile_set" module argument when loading
; module-alsa-card.
;
; So what is this about? Simply, what we do here is map ALSA devices
; to how they are exposed in PA. We say which ALSA device string to
; use to open a device, which channel mapping to use then, and which
; mixer path to use. This is encoded in a 'mapping'. Multiple of these
; mappings can be bound together in a 'profile' which is then directly
; exposed in the UI as a card profile. Each mapping assigned to a
; profile will result in one sink/source to be created if the profile
; is selected for the card.
;
; Additionally, the path set configuration files can describe the
; decibel values assigned to the steps of the volume elements. This
; can be used to work around situations when the alsa driver doesn't
; provide any decibel information, or when the information is
; incorrect.
