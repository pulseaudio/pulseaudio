# The build has two stages. The 'container' stage is used to build a Docker
# container and push it to the project's container registry on fd.o GitLab.
# This step is only run when the tag for the container changes, else it is
# effectively a no-op. All of this infrastructure is inherited from the
# wayland/ci-templates repository which is the recommended way to set up CI
# infrastructure on fd.o GitLab.
#
# Once the container stage is done, we move on to the 'build' stage where we
# run an autotools and meson build in parallel. Currently, tests are also run
# as part of the build stage as there doesn't seem to be significant value to
# splitting the stages at the moment.
